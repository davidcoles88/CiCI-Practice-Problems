How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop,also has a function min which returns the minimum element?  Push, pop, and min should operate in O(1) time.

To create this stack, I would create a function that when either a push or pop occurs the value that is either being pushed or popped is compared to the current minimum value.  The current minimum would have to be stored in a separate stack.  The problem is that the minimum stack as to be sorted so inserting into the stack would occur at O(n) time.  

Answer
To avoid this problem of the O(n) insertion time, we can keep a record of EVERY state.  This however uses a ton of space.  Which is why we would use a separate stack.
