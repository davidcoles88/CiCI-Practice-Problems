You have 20 bottles of pills.  19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.  Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle.  You can only use the scale once.

ANSWER
This assumes that there exists more than 20 pills per container.  Take one pill bottle, put 1 pill for bottle 1, 2 pills for bottle 2, etc (up to 20).  When measured the number after the decimal will reveal the corresponding heavy bottle.
